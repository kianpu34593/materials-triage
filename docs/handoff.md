# Session Handoff - 2026-06-23 13:10

> Single living handoff, git-tracked at `docs/handoff.md`. Keep it **lean** — deep per-session
> history lives in [`docs/handoff-archive.md`](handoff-archive.md); recurring gotchas live in

> - [`docs/ultimate-design.md`](ultimate-design.md) — target design (closed-loop / multi-objective /
>   multi-source / capability-aware; coverage-gap principle; ranking beyond weighted-sum; system-design prep).
> - [`docs/fast-track-learnings.md`](fast-track-learnings.md) — what the throwaway

## Task
Build **Materials-Triage** (public-data-only materials-research triage agent) as single-function TDD
increments, per `Deep-Plan-materials-triage-agent-2026-06-19-1429.md`. The deterministic core, retrieval,
RAG, hypothesis layer, LLM provider, orchestrator, and guardrails are merged. The remaining v1 work is to
**wire it into a working CLI and beat yesterday's fast-track demo on shortlist quality.**

## Plan — path to a "better-than-yesterday" CLI v1
~10 tasks, each a **port-via-TDD** increment (working reference impl on `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`).
One function at a time, stop for approval after each.

**Build order (agreed 2026-06-22).** Each `[ ]` is one TDD increment (one function, stop for approval).
Port every increment from the reference impl on `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`.

**1 · #39 — Source vocabulary binding** *(foundational: kills "vocab drift → empty results", expands past
today's 6 fields; owns the `FIELD_UNITS`/`_FIELD_ORIGIN` lockstep invariant)* — **supply side MERGED (#61)**:
schema-derived vocabulary via `tools/gen_mp_vocab.py` parsing the vendored MP OpenAPI → committed
`_mp_fields.py` (39 fields, units + xc origins); adapter derives `FIELD_UNITS`/`_FIELD_ORIGIN` from it;
`property_vocabulary()` exposes all 39; `PropertyValue.unit` relaxed to `str | None` for dimensionless; the
adapter's `_scalar` VRH-collapse was added (no-mistakes review caught that it was assumed-but-missing →
`retrieve()` crashed on elastic materials). Live-smoked.
- [x] `property_vocabulary()` on the MP adapter — derive queryable name surface from the published API schema
- [x] grow `FIELD_UNITS` + `_FIELD_ORIGIN` in lockstep with the new surface
- [ ] bind the vocabulary into the hypothesis prompt ("use ONLY these names") — **moved to #34** (hypothesis
  node is a pass-through on `main`; fast-track's `_vocabulary_clause`/`_hypothesis_prompt` port lands there)

  Findings: elasticity has no `origins[]` entry (moduli `origin=None`, retiring the dead `"elasticity"` map);
  MP WAFs the `Python-urllib` UA (use `requests`/a UA). [memory: vocab-prebuilt-not-runtime,
  two-model-categories-strictness, materials-project-api]

**2 · #38 — Push #37 predicates server-side** — ✅ **MERGED (#63, 2026-06-23)**. The architecture shifted
mid-build from the original "optimization on top of a local backstop" to a **trusted-adapter / one-owner**
model — see below. (The local-enforcement complement landed separately as 2c / #64.)
- [x] `ElementPredicate none` → `exclude_elements`; `all` → `elements` (was already done)
- [x] `BooleanConstraint` → same-named exact-match param
- [x] `CountConstraint` → `nelements_min`/`nelements_max`
- [x] **numeric `Constraint`** → `<field>_min`/`<field>_max` (reversed the "keep numeric local" call — push
  *everything* MP can express)
- [x] **`PUSHABLE_PARAMS`** — schema-derived gate (generator parses the vendored `/summary` GET params → 124
  names in `_mp_fields.py`); `_query_params` gates on the *computed param name* ∈ this set
- [x] **live contract suite** — each test sources params from the real `_query_params(spec)` and asserts MP
  honours them; this is the safety net (no local re-check)
- [ ] **LOCAL-FILTER REFOCUS → follow-up PR** (the DB-*inexpressible* half; see task **2c** below)

**Architecture as built (supersedes the old "two invariants").** One owner per predicate, decided by the
adapter's capability:
- **Server-side = single authority for everything MP can express** (numeric, boolean, element all/none,
  count). Correctness guaranteed by **live contract tests** (trusted-adapter), *not* a redundant local
  re-check. We deliberately **dropped invariant 1** (re-enforce-everything-locally) as redundant.
- **Pushability ≠ retrievability.** The filterable surface (124 `/summary` GET params) is distinct from and
  larger than the 39 retrievable fields. `is_magnetic` is retrievable but **not** a query param → pushing it
  **400-crashed `retrieve()`** (now fixed by the gate). `bulk_modulus`/`shear_modulus` filter via
  `k_vrh`/`g_vrh`, not `<field>_min` (a hand-pinned `_FILTER_PARAM_BASE` alias — the only non-1:1 case).
  [memory: mp-pushability-not-retrievability]
- **Trade-off accepted:** pushed filters lose per-candidate exclusion reasons in the audit (MP never returns
  the dropped rows); the trace records the *query*. Only locally-enforced predicates produce per-candidate
  `ExcludedCandidate` reasons.

**2c · 🆕 Exclusive-set local filter + make-it-loud (follow-up to #38) — ✅ DATA-PLANE MERGED (#64, 2026-06-23).**
*Direction set by Kian after a multi-source design discussion. Deliberately lighter than "build full local enforcement."*
**Only remaining 2c piece: render caveats in the PI/audit views (blocked on the view layer — see the `[ ]` below).**

**Decided NOT to build (for now):** the universal-local-authority model (re-enforce every predicate locally
so push is pure optimization), the per-source `filter_capability()` declaration, and the per-call residual
report. Reason: a **second database has a different queryable surface**, and we don't yet want to commit to an
abstraction for that — *"do things server-side for now, see how it goes."* Server-side push stays the
**primary** filter (each adapter pushes what its API allows; MP via `PUSHABLE_PARAMS`).

**Local filter — rescoped.** It is **not** a redundant correctness backstop for what servers already do. Its
scope becomes the things a DB *fundamentally can't* express — **derived / holistic / cross-source** concerns
(synthesizability, holistic toxicity, abundance). No data source for those yet ⇒ **deferred**; the local
filter stays minimal.

**AS BUILT — exclusive-set local filter + caveats (merged #64, live-verified).** Kian's refinement
(2026-06-23): rather than only "make it loud," *build a lightweight
filter to capture the exclusive set* — the predicates that are **retrievable but not queryable (R∩¬Q)**,
derived deterministically from the two committed surfaces (`FIELD_UNITS` = R, `PUSHABLE_PARAMS` = Q). This
**enforces** `is_magnetic`/`any` locally (better than caveating them) while staying lightweight and
source-agnostic; only the genuinely-impossible (¬R∩¬Q) is caveated. Four quadrants: R∩Q → server pushes;
**R∩¬Q → local filter (the exclusive set)**; ¬R∩¬Q → **caveat**. Multi-source falls out free (each adapter's
own R/Q → its own exclusive set), so no `filter_capability()` to hand-maintain.
- [x] `SourceAdapter.classify_predicates(spec) → PredicateRouting` (adapter classifies; core stays
  source-agnostic). MP routes booleans/element-`any` to `local_*`, unsupported-field constraints to `caveats`.
- [x] `apply_local_filters(candidates, routing)` (core) — enforces local booleans (`boolean_mismatch`) +
  element `any` (`element_mismatch`); composes after `apply_hard_filters` (numeric). New reasons added.
- [x] `Candidate.elements` + `retrieve` requests-back the local-bucket fields (`is_magnetic`, `elements`) —
  "request back what you filter on."
- [x] orchestrator `_make_filter_node(adapter)` runs both filters into `filter_excluded`; writes
  `routing.caveats` to a new `caveats` channel → `TriageRun.caveats` (the run-level "make it loud").
- [ ] **surface caveats in the PI + audit views — BLOCKED:** no view layer exists yet (`render` is a
  pass-through; future #25–#27). Data is captured in `TriageRun.caveats`; the views read it when built.
- **Pairs with 2b's "bounded + loud" caveat** (cap-hit) — same `caveats` channel, same honesty rationale.

**2b · 🆕 Pagination in `retrieve()`** — ✅ **MERGED (#68, 2026-06-23)**. *Sibling to #38; together they = "retrieve the complete filtered candidate set." Not part of #38 (#38 is the pure `_query_params` transform; this is the I/O loop).*
- [x] page MP's `_skip`/`_limit` to exhaust the (filtered) result set, accumulating candidates
- **AS BUILT (TDD, vertical slices).** `_paginate(http_get, params, headers, ceiling)` loops `_skip` by `_limit`, accumulates docs, stops on a **short page** (fewer than `_limit` rows ⇒ set exhausted) or the **`_MAX_CANDIDATES=10000` ceiling**; returns `(docs, capped)`. **Page size `_DEFAULT_LIMIT` bumped 100 → 1000** (MP's schema-documented `_limit` max — "Limited to 1000" in `mp_summary_schema.json` — chosen to minimize HTTP calls / blacklist risk per Kian). Ceiling hit ⇒ a **loud caveat** ("result set capped at 10000…; ranking over a subset"), never a silent bigger truncation.
- **Contract change (Kian-approved): `retrieve(spec) -> RetrievalResult(candidates, caveats)`** (was `list[Candidate]`). New frozen model in `core/schema.py`. The I/O loop reports an incomplete set as a *first-class output*, not hidden state / a side channel. `SourceAdapter` base + deferred stubs adopt it.
- **Orchestrator wiring:** retrieve node splits the result into the `candidates` channel + a **new single-writer `retrieval_caveats` channel** (preserves the single-writer-per-stage invariant). `export_run` **unions** `retrieval_caveats + caveats` into `TriageRun.caveats` — mirrors how `result.excluded` unions the two exclusion channels at the presentation boundary (NOT a filter-node read+merge). [memory: orchestrator-exclusions-two-sources]
- **The three requirements met:** (1) **filter-first** — depends on #38 (merged ✅), which shrinks N to a pageable set. (2) **bounded + loud** — ceiling + caveat, same `caveats` honesty channel as 2b's cap notice + 2c. (3) **adapter-owned** — `_skip`/`_limit` stay inside `retrieve`; contract is still `retrieve(spec) -> complete set` (now wrapped in `RetrievalResult`).
- **Coverage caveat:** multi-page behavior at *real* settings (1000/page) isn't exercised offline (would need 1000+ fixture docs); `_paginate` unit tests drive the loop with small `_limit`, the cap-caveat test monkeypatches the ceiling low, and a `live` run would exercise the real cadence.
- **Review-fix (merged in #68):** `_paginate` checks **exhaustion before the ceiling** — a complete set whose final short page lands exactly on the ceiling is no longer falsely flagged `capped` (it fails loud, but misreporting a complete set is still wrong). no-mistakes review caught it.

> **H₂O is not fixed here.** "Metal oxides" must compile to `all={O}` AND `any={metallic elements}` so water
> (has O, no metal) drops at the hard-filter stage. That needs the *set* of metals — **#37 area B
> (element-class constants), currently deferred** — plus the LLM choosing to emit the predicate (#39 + #22).
> It is a spec-expressiveness + LLM-comprehension problem: not #38, and **not** synthesis (synthesis narrates
> the ranked shortlist and may not silently reorder/drop). See the leverage-order note under Discoveries.

**3 · Synthesis & validation primitives** — ✅ **MERGED (#69, 2026-06-23)** (additive, pure,
pagination-/orchestrator-independent; the synthesis NODE wiring itself is deferred to #34).
- [x] **#20** output validator — `agent/validator.py` `validate_output(result, synthesis, retrieved_ids)`
  raises `UngroundedOutputError` unless every presented candidate (ranked AND excluded) and every
  narrative citation resolves to retrieved provenance; returns `None` on a clean output.
- [x] **#35** synthesis — `core/synthesis.py` `GroundedClaim`/`Synthesis` (frozen) +
  `ungrounded_record_ids(synthesis, valid_ids)` (order-preserving, de-duplicated cited ids that don't
  resolve to a retrieved candidate — the grounding check the validator and the synthesis retry loop share).
- [x] **#22** synthesis prompt — `agent/prompts.py` `build_synthesis_prompt(goal, result, snippets, *, nonce)`:
  the citable ranked shortlist (id+formula+score) is TRUSTED instruction text, while the user goal and the
  RAG `LiteraturePassage` snippets are UNTRUSTED DATA fenced via `wrap_untrusted` with the call's nonce.
  (Hypothesis-prompt binding still pending → #34.)

**3b · 🆕 Geometric-mean ranker = the agent default + schema surfaced to the LLM** — ✅ **MERGED (#70,
2026-06-23)**. *Follow-up to #66 (which added the selectable geometric ranker). Direction set by Kian.*
- [x] `compile_spec(proposals, *, ranking_method="geometric_mean")` — the agent now defaults to the
  non-compensatory weighted geometric mean (a single unacceptable property zeros a candidate). DECISION:
  defaulted in `compile_spec` (the agent path), NOT the `TriageSpec` field default (which stays
  `arithmetic_mean`) — small blast radius, raw construction stays flexible; arithmetic reachable via the kwarg.
- [x] **Schema surfaced — structured half:** `Field(description=...)` on `RankingTarget`
  direction/lower/target/upper/curvature/weight/on_missing, so the `with_structured_output(Hypothesis)` JSON
  schema tells the LLM the ramp anchors are *required* by the geometric ranker.
- [x] **Schema surfaced — prose half:** `prompts.RANKING_TARGET_GUIDANCE` wired into the hypothesis prompt
  (first attempt AND retry), instructing the LLM to announce explicit ramp bounds per direction (no pool fallback).
- [x] **Terminal-failure fix (review-driven, #70):** because the geometric ranker requires every target to
  carry ramp bounds but `RankingTarget` leaves anchors optional, a bounds-less hypothesis passes the
  `Hypothesis` structured-output schema, then *used to* die one stage later in `spec_build`'s `compile_spec` as
  a non-retried, feedback-less `SpecCompilationError`. Fix: the hypothesis node now **trial-compiles** each
  shape-valid candidate via `compile_spec` *inside its retry loop*, so a compile `ValidationError` (missing
  bounds, duplicate constraint, contradiction) is fed back to the LLM and self-corrects. `spec_build`'s
  `SpecCompilationError` wrapper remains the backstop for a hypothesis seeded directly into state (resume/bypass).

**4 · #34 — Wire the orchestrator** *(replace the remaining PASS-THROUGH nodes)*
- [ ] gate node · [ ] synthesis node · [ ] output_validate node
- [~] hypothesis node — already a real node (LLM + retry); #70 added the **trial-compile-in-retry** so it
  guarantees a *compilable* hypothesis. Still TODO under #34: bind the source **vocabulary** into the
  hypothesis prompt ("use ONLY these names"); wire `build_synthesis_prompt` + `validate_output` into the
  synthesis/output_validate nodes.

**5 · Renderers → CLI** *(render BOTH views from ONE `TriageRun`)*
- [ ] **#25** PI renderer (`view=pi`) · [ ] **#26** audit renderer (`view=audit`)
- [ ] **#27** CLI — `triage "<q>" --view pi|audit`; `resume`

**6 · Capstone / polish**
- [ ] **#41** notebooks refresh
- [ ] **#40** RAG→synthesis (citations + caveats + ordering-fidelity) — unblocks after #35 + #20

**Out of scope for the CLI:** #28 (eval), #29/#30/#36 (docs), #31 (drop reasons), all HB* hosting tasks,
#37 area B (element-class constants) — **deferred**. (#37 area C "ranking beyond weighted-sum" is **partly
shipped** by #66 — the geometric-mean desirability ranker — see "Ranking" below.)

**Ranking — selectable arithmetic/geometric-mean rankers — ✅ MERGED (#66, 2026-06-23).** A second
deterministic ranker now sits alongside the preserved weighted-sum, selected per run by
`TriageSpec.ranking_method` (recorded → traceable/replayable). `arithmetic_mean` (default, unchanged
behavior) is the old `rank()` renamed; `geometric_mean` is the non-compensatory weighted geometric mean of
per-target **Derringer–Suich desirability curves** (`maximize`/`minimize`/`target` "moderate-is-best" shapes
+ a curvature exponent). The contract is fail-fast at spec construction (no silent wrong answers):
- **anchors/curvature are geometric-only** — rejected under `arithmetic_mean` (it scores via pool-relative
  `normalize`, which would silently ignore them); a `target` direction *requires* `geometric_mean`.
- **`geometric_mean` requires announced absolute bounds on every target** (no pool fallback) — so a `0`
  desirability means a genuine acceptability-floor failure, not merely pool-worst (which the geometric mean
  would catastrophically zero). Per direction: maximize→`lower`+`target`, minimize→`target`+`upper`,
  target→all three; strictly ascending; the unused monotonic anchor must be omitted.
- **`arithmetic_mean` keeps pool fallback** (additive, no catastrophic zero).
- **Default stays `arithmetic_mean`** (zero-setup). Flipping the default to `geometric_mean` is **deferred to
  the #34/#22 PR** — because a default-geometric spec forces every target to announce bounds, which nothing
  upstream provides until the hypothesis prompt does. **The bounds announcement is the #34/#22 hypothesis
  responsibility** (the ranking step only enforces via the schema → LLM retry). [memory:
  desirability-ranking-bounds-same-source]

## What's merged on `main` (the foundation to build on)
- **Core:** `core/schema.py` (all frozen models; `Provenance` now carries required `method` + optional
  `xc_functional`), `core/elements.py`, `core/scoring.py` (`apply_hard_filters`/`on_missing`),
  `core/ranking.py` (**two selectable rankers**: `rank_arithmetic_mean` weighted-average + `rank_geometric_mean`
  desirability, #66), `core/scoring.py` also carries the desirability primitives (`desirability_curve`,
  `resolve_bounds`, `score_desirability`), `core/hypothesis.py` (models + `compile_spec`, `kind`-discriminated
  union). #37 spec expressiveness areas **A** (BooleanConstraint / ElementPredicate all·any·none /
  CountConstraint) + **D** (trust metadata) shipped.
- **Retrieval:** `sources/base.py` + `stubs.py` + `materials_project.py` — MP adapter does a **two-call**
  retrieve (summary → batched `/materials/tasks/` for per-property `xc_functional`). `retrieval/rag.py`
  BM25 literature RAG (abstract-only).
- **#39 vocabulary (merged #61):** `tools/gen_mp_vocab.py` + vendored `tools/mp_summary_schema.json` →
  committed `src/materials_triage/sources/_mp_fields.py` (39-field `{unit, origin}` table); adapter derives
  `FIELD_UNITS`/`_FIELD_ORIGIN` from it and exposes `property_vocabulary()`; `_scalar` collapses the VRH
  moduli dict; `PropertyValue.unit: str | None` (dimensionless). `tools/` on the test pythonpath.
- **#38 server-side push (merged #63):** `_query_params` pushes every DB-expressible hard filter (numeric
  `<field>_min/_max`, booleans, `elements`/`exclude_elements`, `nelements` range), gated on the schema-derived
  **`PUSHABLE_PARAMS`** (124 `/summary` GET params, now also generated into `_mp_fields.py`). Fixes the
  `is_magnetic` 400 + maps the moduli via the `k_vrh`/`g_vrh` alias (`_FILTER_PARAM_BASE`). A `live`-marked
  **contract suite** (params sourced from the real `_query_params`) verifies MP honours each — the
  trusted-adapter safety net. [memory: mp-pushability-not-retrievability]
- **2c exclusive-set local filter (merged #64):** `SourceAdapter.classify_predicates(spec) -> PredicateRouting`
  (R∩¬Q → local, ¬R∩¬Q → caveat). `core/scoring.py` `apply_local_filters` enforces local booleans
  (`boolean_mismatch`) + element `any` (`element_mismatch`); `Candidate.elements` + retrieve request-back;
  orchestrator `_make_filter_node(adapter)` runs both filters + writes `TriageRun.caveats`. Live-verified.
- **2b pagination (merged #68):** `_paginate` (loops `_skip`/`_limit`, short-page/ceiling stop, `(docs, capped)`),
  `retrieve() -> RetrievalResult(candidates, caveats)`, `_DEFAULT_LIMIT=1000`/`_MAX_CANDIDATES=10000` + loud
  cap-caveat; orchestrator `retrieval_caveats` channel; `export_run` unions retrieval + filter caveats.
- **#69 synthesis & validation primitives (merged #69):** `core/synthesis.py` (`GroundedClaim`, `Synthesis`,
  `ungrounded_record_ids`), `agent/validator.py` (`validate_output`, `UngroundedOutputError`),
  `agent/prompts.py` `build_synthesis_prompt`. Pure/additive; synthesis NODE wiring is #34.
- **3b geometric default + schema surfacing (merged #70):** `compile_spec(..., ranking_method="geometric_mean")`
  default; `RankingTarget` `Field(description=...)`; `prompts.RANKING_TARGET_GUIDANCE` in the hypothesis prompt;
  hypothesis node **trial-compiles in its retry loop** so non-compiling proposals self-correct.
- **Agent:** `agent/llm.py` Bedrock `HypothesisProvider` (injected `complete` seam; `us.*` inference-profile
  model id). `agent/prompts.py` `ROLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + `build_chat_messages` + `build_synthesis_prompt` +
  `RANKING_TARGET_GUIDANCE`. `agent/orchestrator.py` LangGraph graph with per-stage exclusion/caveat channels +
  hypothesis retry (shape + trial-compile) + spec-build HITL gate; `core/run_trace.py` audit export +
  `memory/store.py` `BaseStore`. **⚠️ gate / synthesis / output_validate nodes are still PASS-THROUGHS**
  (hypothesis + spec_build + retrieve + filter + rank are real) — wiring the rest is #34.
- **Guardrails:** `policy/guardrails.py` `check_input` + `wrap_untrusted` + `_scrub`.
- **Server (net-new, outside v1 deep-plan):** `server/mt_server/policy.py` `resolve_model` (#52); `server/`
  wired into pytest. See the hosting task list below.
- **Docs/ADRs:** 0001 retrieval · 0002 RAG abstracts-only · 0003 orchestrator-on-LangGraph · 0004 guardrail
  threat-model · 0005 hosting & step-cache.
- **Reference impl (NOT on `main`):** `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails` (local + origin) — full end-to-end
  wiring + `core/synthesis.py`, `agent/validator.py`, `render.py`, `cli.py`. Port from it. (NB:
  `property_vocabulary()` + the VRH `_scalar` collapse are now **on `main`** via #61 — no longer "port from
  reference." ⚠️ Verify each remaining helper actually exists on `main` before citing it — the `_scalar`
  assumption-not-verified bug is exactly how #61's review caught a crash. [memory: verify-against-main-not-reference-impl])

## Status
- **`main` @ `de097e0`**, clean, **296 tests pass** (10 `live` deselected), ruff clean. Three features
  merged this session via no-mistakes: **#68 pagination (2b)**, **#69 synthesis primitives (#20/#35/#22)**,
  **#70 geometric-mean default + schema surfacing + trial-compile fix (3b)**. (#66 selectable ranker landed
  too, the predecessor of 3b.)
- **The deterministic + retrieval + LLM-input layers are now complete.** What's left for v1 is the remaining
  LLM NODE wiring (#34: gate/synthesis/output_validate + vocabulary binding) and presentation (views #25–#27).
- **no-mistakes note:** the pipeline this session **merged the PRs itself** (outcome `passed`, not just
  `checks-passed`) and **auto-resolved the rebase conflict** (#70's `prompts.py`/`test_prompts.py` overlap with
  #69) — no manual UI merge needed those rounds. Earlier #68 attempts hit transient `529 Overloaded` at the
  review step (retry cleared it). [memory: no-mistakes-run-bootstrap]
- **#38 + 2c done** (#63/#64): full filtering architecture on `main` — server-side primary (PUSHABLE_PARAMS) +
  local exclusive-set filter (R∩¬Q) + loud caveats (¬R∩¬Q → TriageRun.caveats). #39 supply side (#61), #37
  (A #51 + D #55) done.
- **Known issues / loose ends:**
  - **Geometric-default asymmetry (info, #70 review, no-op):** `compile_spec` defaults `geometric_mean` while
    the `TriageSpec` model field default stays `arithmetic_mean`. Deliberate + documented, but raw
    `TriageSpec(...)` and the agent path disagree on the default ranker — a latent gotcha.
  - **4 informational nits from #64's review** to fix opportunistically (next time touching the files):
    (1) `classify_predicates` comment oversells — the ¬R caveat is *additive* (explains the empty result),
    NOT *protective*; `apply_hard_filters` still drops the candidates as `missing_data`. (2) `classify_predicates`
    runs twice per run (retrieve + filter) — pure, harmless. (3) duplicate caveat strings if a numeric + boolean
    constraint share a property name. (4) `element_mismatch` conflates "composition not fetched" with "members
    genuinely absent" (boolean branch distinguishes `missing_data`).
  - Live Bedrock smoke test ~15% flaky by design (mitigated by the #45 retry loop).
  - LangGraph msgpack "unregistered type" warnings on our pydantic models — round-trips today, will block in a
    future version [memory: langgraph-msgpack-unregistered-types].

Ready now: **HB4** (tier/rate-limit/metering), **HB5**, **HB6**, HB1's remaining `[server]` extra.

## Discoveries that still bite (curated; full list in archive + MEMORY.md)
- **Quality ceiling = spec-schema expressiveness, NOT the LLM/prompt.** Leverage order: schema (#37) >
  server-side filters (#38) > prompt (#22). H₂O survived three prompt revisions because the schema couldn't
  express "must contain a metal" — not because the filter ran in the wrong place. So the fix is **#37 area B
  (element-class constants, deferred)** + the LLM emitting `any={metals}` (#39/#22), NOT #38 and NOT synthesis.
  #38 only changes *where* an existing filter runs (the `_limit=100`-before-return truncation), never *whether*
  one exists. [memory: spec-expressiveness-quality-ceiling]
- **Vocabulary binding (#39):** the *adapter*, not the LLM, owns the queryable name surface; publish it via
  `property_vocabulary()` and feed the prompt "use ONLY these names," or you get silent empty results.
- **Only the live end-to-end run finds integration bugs** unit tests miss (vocab drift, PI/audit view
  mismatch, VRH-dict crash). Render BOTH views from ONE `TriageRun`. *#61 corollary:* a placeholder test
  value (`bulk_modulus=1.0`) hid the real `{voigt,reuss,vrh}`-dict crash — fixtures for object-typed fields
  must use the **real payload shape**, and verify a ported helper exists on `main` before citing it (the
  no-mistakes review's grep caught the missing `_scalar`). [memory: verify-against-main-not-reference-impl]
- **Pagination (2b): MP `_limit` caps at 1000** ("Limited to 1000." in the vendored `mp_summary_schema.json`)
  — a *bigger* page size means *fewer* HTTP calls for the same set, so 1000 is the gentlest-on-the-API choice
  (counter-intuitively: larger page ≠ more blacklist risk). The composite weighted-average rank **can't** be
  pushed (MP sorts on one field), so the ranker must see the whole filtered set locally → pagination is
  mandatory, not optional. Default-arg gotcha: `_paginate(ceiling=_MAX_CANDIDATES)` binds 10000 at def time,
  so `retrieve` passes the ceiling **explicitly** (else `monkeypatch.setattr(mp, "_MAX_CANDIDATES", …)` in a
  test wouldn't reach it). Caveats split by stage like exclusions: `retrieval_caveats` (retrieve node) +
  `caveats` (filter node), unioned in `export_run`. [memory: orchestrator-exclusions-two-sources]
- **Geometric default (3b): a shape-valid hypothesis can still fail to *compile*.** The geometric ranker
  requires every `RankingTarget` to carry ramp bounds, but anchors are optional on `RankingTarget`, so a
  bounds-less hypothesis passes `Hypothesis` structured-output validation and only fails later in
  `spec_build`'s `compile_spec`. The retry loop that re-prompts the LLM lives in the **hypothesis node**, so the
  fix is to **trial-compile inside that loop** (catch the compile `ValidationError` there, feed it back) —
  otherwise the error is terminal and feedback-less. General lesson: any retry-worthy LLM-output failure must be
  detected where the retry+re-prompt happens, not a stage later. Surfacing the schema to the LLM has two halves:
  pydantic `Field(description=...)` (structured, reaches Bedrock via `with_structured_output`) AND prose in the
  prompt; conditional requirements (bounds-iff-geometric) can't be expressed in JSON schema, so they ride a
  `model_validator` + the retry seam. [memory: llm-structured-output-flakiness, two-model-categories-strictness]
- **Pushability ≠ retrievability (#38).** What a field *returns* and what it can be *filtered on* are two
  surfaces. The `/summary` GET endpoint declares **124 query params** (≠ the 39 retrievable fields):
  `is_magnetic` is retrievable but not queryable (pushing it **400s**), and the moduli filter via
  `k_vrh`/`g_vrh` not `<field>_min`. Schema-derive the pushable set (`PUSHABLE_PARAMS`), gate on it, and
  **trust the adapter** — the live contract suite (params sourced from the real `_query_params`) is the only
  thing catching a silently-ignored/typo'd param, since there's no local re-check. [memory:
  mp-pushability-not-retrievability]
- **MP OpenAPI for the vocabulary:** at `GET /openapi.json` (3.1.0; `SummaryDoc` = 69 props) — needs the
  `X_API_KEY` header **and** a non-`urllib` User-Agent (MP WAFs `Python-urllib/*` → 403; `requests` passes).
  Origins are a small controlled set; **elasticity has no `origins[]` entry** (moduli `origin=None`,
  functional untraceable) and surface energies trace only to method-named docs. [memory: materials-project-api]
- **Encode LLM contracts in the JSON schema, not hidden `model_validator`s** (discriminated union). LLM
  structured output is ~15% schema-flaky → the orchestrator retry loop is load-bearing. [memory: llm-structured-output-flakiness]
- **MP API:** sandboxed mirror, `X_API_KEY` header; query-id ≠ returned-id; units not in payload (pinned in
  adapter); functional lives in the task doc, varies per-property. [memory: materials-project-api, dft-xc-functional-comparability-v2]
- **no-mistakes:** bootstrap from the **main repo** (not a worktree); `git push no-mistakes <branch>` → `axi
  abort` → `axi run --intent`; verify locally with `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" pytest`. [memory: no-mistakes-run-bootstrap]
  *#66 corollary:* runs are per-branch and coexist concurrently (multiple sessions ran in parallel fine); a
  worktree can drive `respond`/`rerun`, only the bootstrap *push* must come from the main repo. Transient
  `529 Overloaded` API errors crash the no-mistakes Claude agents (review/fix/lint) → just `rerun`.
- **Desirability/geometric ranker (#66): min-max normalization + a non-compensatory geometric mean is a trap.**
  Pool-relative `d=0` (worst-in-pool) under `Π dᵢ^wᵢ` zeros a candidate's whole score for being last on *one*
  axis — so the geometric ranker must use **absolute announced bounds** where `0` means a real floor failure,
  never pool fallback. Mixing one announced + one pooled anchor also flips a ramp's sign (maximize → minimize)
  → the **same-source rule**. The fix family is all fail-fast spec validation ("no silent wrong answers"): same
  theme as H₂O. Announcing the bounds is an **upstream/hypothesis** duty (#34/#22). [memory:
  desirability-ranking-bounds-same-source]

## Design direction (v2+): XC-functional-FIRST retrieval, not canonical-value acceptance
*Raised by Kian 2026-06-23 while tracing #38's per-property functional handling. Important; likely **not v1**.*

**The problem.** DFT property values vary *a lot* by XC functional, and they are not cross-comparable.
Today the MP adapter accepts MP's **canonical** summary value per property and merely *tags* its
functional on provenance (`xc_functional`) — it never chooses the functional or guards comparability. So a
`band_gap` ranking can silently mix a GGA value (material A) with an r2SCAN value (material B), which is
physically wrong. **We should not blindly accept the canonical value.** A scientist who knows the tasks
fixes the functional *first*, then fetches the value.

**Domain rule (which functional, and why).** The right functional is largely determined by the
property/material class *before* retrieval:
- **GGA** — fine for many **energies** / relative stability; the broadest data coverage.
- **GGA+U** — needed for **strongly-correlated** materials (transition-metal oxides, localized d/f electrons).
- **r2SCAN** — **most accurate** (better gaps, energetics), but also the **sparsest** data → choosing it
  trades accuracy for coverage. This coverage/accuracy tension is the crux of the iterate loop below.

**Proposed agent behavior (v2):**
1. **Decide the XC functional at the *hypothesis* phase** — make it an explicit, cited part of the spec
   (a new spec field, e.g. `xc_functional` preference/requirement), reasoned from property + material class,
   not left to MP's canonicalization.
2. **Retrieve values computed with that functional** — query/filter by `run_type` (push it as a retrieval
   constraint and/or filter the per-property provenance to the chosen functional) instead of accepting the
   canonical value. The value the pipeline ranks on must be the chosen-functional value.
3. **Iterate on coverage** — if too few materials have a value at the chosen functional (e.g. r2SCAN is
   sparse), **fall back to a different functional on a second turn** and record the swap as a caveat. This is
   a natural fit for the existing traced state machine + `resume`/iterate design (the run already supports
   re-running a step) and the multi-turn hypothesis loop.

**Implications / open questions for whoever picks this up:**
- Spec schema grows an XC-functional dimension (LLM-output model → keep it strict; see
  [memory: two-model-categories-strictness]). This is another instance of "quality ceiling = spec
  expressiveness" [memory: spec-expressiveness-quality-ceiling].
- Retrieval changes from "one canonical value + tag" to "value *selected by* functional." Needs the
  per-property functional **before** ranking, and a defined precedence/fallback order (r2SCAN → GGA+U → GGA?).
- The single-canonical assumption in `_origin_task_ids` (one task per origin group; dict last-wins on a
  duplicate origin name) must be revisited — multiple same-property tasks at different functionals become
  *first-class*, not collapsed by MP. The values for non-chosen functionals are in the raw `/tasks/` store,
  not the summary — so this likely needs task-level retrieval, not just summary.
- Supersedes the "tag only" stance of [memory: dft-xc-functional-comparability-v2] (PR #55 added the tag;
  this is the *consumption* — choose + fetch + flag/restrict ranking by functional).

## Context for Next Session
- **Branch:** `main` @ `de097e0`, clean. Build the next increment in a **worktree** off `main`
  (`PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" pytest`; no-mistakes bootstrap must run from the **main repo**, not the worktree —
  remove the worktree + checkout the branch in the main repo to ship). Other branches: `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`
  (reference impl, keep), `docs/handoff-66` (a stale handoff branch, not ours — ignore).
- **Verify merged state:** `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" python -m pytest -q` (296 pass, 10 deselected); `ruff check .`.
  Live (needs creds): `pytest -m live`.
- **Next up (pick one):** (a) **#34** — wire the remaining pass-through nodes (gate / synthesis via
  `build_synthesis_prompt` / output_validate via `validate_output`) + bind the source **vocabulary** into the
  hypothesis prompt (the last #39 increment). The synthesis/validator primitives (#69) are ready to wire in.
  (b) **views / render** (#25–#27) — unblocks 2c's *and* 2b's caveat rendering (both feed `TriageRun.caveats`)
  plus the synthesis narrative. Deterministic + retrieval + LLM-input layers are complete; the v1 gaps are the
  LLM node wiring (#34) and presentation (views).
- **Credentials:** `X_API_KEY` (MP), `OPENALEX_MAILTO` (optional polite pool), AWS creds for Bedrock
  (prefer `~/.aws/credentials`; conftest `load_dotenv`s `.env`; AWS keys in `.env` must be UPPERCASE).
  **Never read/print the AWS creds or `X_API_KEY`.**
- **Git workflow:** `main` protected, signed commits (`git commit -S`), squash-merge via GitHub UI, then
  `/sync-main`. Ship via `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr` or no-mistakes. pre-commit `ruff format` can
  abort a commit → re-add + re-commit.
- **Collaboration rules (CLAUDE.md):** ask before choosing between approaches; one function at a time then
  stop for approval; TDD via the `tdd` skill (never batch tests); **don't start coding until told.**
- **Task tracker:** v1 path = ~~#39~~, ~~#38~~, ~~2c~~, ~~2b pagination (#68)~~, ~~#20/#35/#22 synthesis &
  validation primitives (#69)~~, ~~3b geometric default + schema surfacing (#70)~~ → **#34** ← suggested next,
  then #25, #26, #27, #41, #40 (see Plan). Completed: #1–#19, #21, #23, #24, #32, #33, #37, #39 (supply side;
  vocabulary binding → #34), **#38 (#63)**, **2c (#64)**, **2b pagination (#68)**, **#20/#35/#22 primitives
  (#69; node wiring → #34)**, **#66 selectable ranker + 3b geometric default/schema/trial-compile (#70)**.
  Open within 2c + 2b: render caveats in views (blocked on the view layer #25–#27; both feed `TriageRun.caveats`).
  Deferred: #37 area B/C (area B on the critical path for "metal oxides"); the **multi-source filter abstraction**
  (universal local / filter_capability / residual — "see how it goes"); **v2 XC-functional-first retrieval**
  (design note above). Hosting = HB1–HB10.
