## Task
Build **Materials-Triage** (public-data-only materials-research triage agent) as single-function
TDD increments, per `Deep-Plan-materials-triage-agent-2026-06-19-1429.md`. **Merged to `main`:** core
data models, deterministic logic (scoring + ranking), retrieval (MP adapter), literature RAG (#17),
hypothesis layer (#32), Bedrock provider (#21), the LangGraph orchestrator (#23 incl. hypothesis retry
+ spec-build HITL gate, plus #24 crash-recovery resume + #9/#10 audit-export & lab-memory), the
**input-side guardrails** (input policy gate #18 + trust boundary #19, PR #46), and the **role system
prompt** (`agent/prompts.py`, PR #46). **Remaining for v1:** wire those primitives into the
orchestrator nodes (**#34** — gate/hypothesis/synthesis/output_validate are still pass-throughs on
`main`), output validator (#20), the rest of the prompts (#22), synthesis step (#35), PI/audit
renderers (#25/#26), CLI (#27), eval harness (#28), design note (#29), README/CLAUDE finalize (#30),
element-drop reasons (#31), docs follow-up (#36). A throwaway **fast-track branch**
(`feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`) already proved the full wiring end-to-end; only its docs were
merged (#48/#49) — the real build re-implements via TDD.

## Scope
- **DONE + merged:** data models (schema.py), logic (scoring.py + ranking.py), retrieval
  (SourceAdapter + Materials Project adapter), **literature RAG (#17)**, **hypothesis layer
  (models + `compile_spec`, now a `kind`-discriminated union)**, **Bedrock LLM provider (#21)**,
  demo notebooks + ADRs 0001/0002.
- **Orchestrator #23 on LangGraph — BUILT + MERGED** (parallel session): LangGraph skeleton with
  per-stage exclusion channels (#41), then hypothesis retry + spec-build HITL gate (#23). #9/#10 are
  subsumed (checkpointer ⊇ #9 trace+resume; `BaseStore` ⊇ #10 lab memory; `interrupt()` = spec HITL);
  `runs/<id>.json` is a **derived read-model exported from checkpoint history**, not a second store.
  [memory: langgraph-orchestrator-decision]
- **Input-side guardrails (#18/#19) — BUILT + MERGED (PR #46):** deterministic `check_input`
  (allowlist-first scope triage, weakest of 5 layers — NOT the safety guarantee), `wrap_untrusted`
  trust-boundary wrapper (XML + per-request nonce + escaping + `_scrub` hygiene), and the
  `ROLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + `build_chat_messages` in `agent/prompts.py` (user text never in the system
  slot). v2 = hybrid LLM scope check. [memory: input-gate-mechanism-decision] · ADR 0004 (+expansion).
- **Fast-track demo (throwaway, NOT merged to `main`):** branch `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`
  wired gate→hypothesis (trust-boundary + vocabulary binding)→retrieve→filter→rank→synthesis→
  output-validate→render end-to-end + a CLI, and ran live against MP + Bedrock to prove the design.
  Only the **docs** were PR'd (#48 README flowchart, #49 fast-track-learnings + ultimate-design).
  Learnings in `docs/fast-track-learnings.md`; the branch is the **reference implementation** to port.
- **Next up (real build, one TDD increment at a time):** output validator (#20) → wire primitives
  into orchestrator nodes (#34) → finish prompts (#22) → synthesis (#35) → renderers (#25/#26) →
  CLI (#27) → eval (#28) → design note (#29) → README/CLAUDE finalize (#30) → element-drop reasons
  (#31) → docs follow-up (#36).
- **Collaboration rules (CLAUDE.md — follow exactly):** ask before choosing between approaches;
  implement ONE function at a time then stop for approval; TDD via the `tdd` skill (one red→green
  at a time, never batch); discuss behavior before coding; **don't start coding until told**.

## Files
- `src/materials_triage/core/schema.py` — all frozen data models (merged). `Provenance` now carries
  `method` (required Literal incl. `literature`) + `xc_functional` (optional) — trust metadata, #37 area
  D (#55).
- `src/materials_triage/core/elements.py` — 118 IUPAC element symbols (merged).
- `src/materials_triage/core/scoring.py` — `normalize` + `apply_hard_filters` + `on_missing` (merged).
- `src/materials_triage/core/ranking.py` — weighted-average ranker (merged).
- `src/materials_triage/core/hypothesis.py` — hypothesis models + `compile_spec` seam (merged #30),
  **now a `kind`-discriminated union** (`ConstraintProposal`/`RankingProposal`/`ElementRuleProposal`
  behind `Field(discriminator="kind")`, `extra="forbid"`; merged #34). `Proposal` is a type alias —
  construct the concrete subclass. `compile_spec` unchanged (dispatches on `.kind`).
- `src/materials_triage/sources/base.py` / `stubs.py` / `materials_project.py` — retrieval (merged).
  `materials_project.py` now does a **two-call** retrieve (summary→batched tasks) to stamp each value's
  `xc_functional` from its task `run_type`; helpers `_FIELD_ORIGIN` / `_origin_task_ids` /
  `_field_task_id` / `_fetch_run_types` / `_page_task_ids` (#37 area D, #55).
- `src/materials_triage/retrieval/rag.py` — **literature RAG (#17), MERGED (#31)**. Surface:
  `LiteraturePassage`, `LiteratureRAG.search(query, k=10)`, `AbstractFetcher` (Protocol),
  `OpenAlexFetcher` (live transport). Internals: `_reconstruct_abstract`, `_parse_work`,
  `_tokenize`, `_rank`.
- `src/materials_triage/agent/llm.py` — **Bedrock `HypothesisProvider` (#21), MERGED (#36).**
  `propose(prompt) -> Hypothesis` via an injected `complete` seam (offline-testable like the MP
  adapter's `http_get`); lazy default wraps `ChatBedrockConverse.with_structured_output(Hypothesis)`,
  importing `langchain_aws` only on invocation. `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` is the `us.*` inference-profile id
  (on-demand requires it).
- `tests/test_llm.py` — provider tests B1–B4 (merged #36): tracer, prompt-verbatim spy, lazy-construct
  guard, and a `live` Bedrock smoke test gated on botocore-resolvable creds, **documented ~15% flaky**.
- `tests/conftest.py` — `load_dotenv()` at collection time (defensive import) so live tests read
  creds from `.env` before `skipif` gates evaluate (merged #36).
- `tests/test_hypothesis.py` — migrated to subclass construction + schema regression test (merged #34).
- `tests/test_rag.py` — RAG tests (merged #31); `omits mailto when unset` made hermetic via
  `monkeypatch.delenv` (merged #36).
- `pyproject.toml` — runtime deps `pydantic>=2`, `requests>=2`, `rank-bm25>=0.2`; extras `dev`
  (+`python-dotenv`), `notebook`, **`llm` (`langchain-aws`)**; `live` pytest marker (deselected).
- `src/materials_triage/agent/orchestrator.py` — **LangGraph orchestrator, MERGED** (#41 skeleton +
  per-stage exclusion channels; **#45** hypothesis retry + spec-build HITL gate; **#47** audit export +
  crash-recovery resume + lab memory = #23/#24/#9/#10). **Note:** the gate / hypothesis / synthesis /
  output_validate nodes are still **pass-throughs** — wiring the guardrails/prompts/synthesis/validator
  into them is the pending **#34** (reference impl on `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`).
- `src/materials_triage/agent/prompts.py` — **role prompt (part of #22), MERGED (#46).**
  `ROLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (identity + scope + hard constraints + trust-boundary directive) and pure
  `build_chat_messages(query, *, nonce) -> [("system", role), ("human", wrap_untrusted(query))]`.
- `src/materials_triage/core/run_trace.py` (#9) + `src/materials_triage/memory/store.py` (#10) —
  audit-export read-model + `BaseStore` lab memory, MERGED (#47).
- **Branch-only (on `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`, NOT on `main`):** `core/synthesis.py` (#35),
  `agent/validator.py` (#20), `render.py` (#25/#26), `cli.py` (#27), `scripts/demo.py`, and the
  `sources` `property_vocabulary()` + VRH `_scalar` collapse — reference impls for #20/#25/#26/#27/#34/#35.
- `src/materials_triage/policy/guardrails.py` — **input policy gate (#18) + trust boundary (#19),
  MERGED (#46).** `check_input(text) -> GateDecision`; frozen `GateDecision(allowed, reason, category)`;
  deterministic forbidden-action denylist (categories `wet_lab`/`private_data`/`paywalled`);
  `wrap_untrusted(text, *, label, nonce)` (XML + nonce + escaping) and `_scrub` input hygiene.
- `tests/test_guardrails.py` — gate + wrapper tests (MERGED #46): in-scope allowed + forbidden-action
  refusals + wrapper breakout-neutralization (persistent deterministic red-team cases).
- `docs/design/0003-orchestrator-on-langgraph.md` (ADR, #40) · `0004-guardrail-architecture-threat-model.md`
  (ADR, #42; **expanded** with wrapper construction + attack-surface table, #43).
- `docs/design/0001-retrieval-rest-adapters.md` (#29) · `0002-literature-abstracts-only.md` (#31).
- `docs/design/0005-hosting-and-step-cache.md` — **hosting/billing/step-cache ADR, MERGED (#53).**
  `.lavish/` is now in the tracked `.gitignore`. ⚠️ The stale local `.git/info/exclude` line 9 (the
  ADR path) is now obsolete (file is tracked) and can be deleted.
- `server/mt_server/policy.py` — **first server-side unit, MERGED (#52).** `resolve_model(tier,
  requested, *, default, allowed)`: anon→`default` (requested silently pinned, not an error);
  signed-in→requested if in `allowed`, `default` if none, `ValueError` if unoffered; unknown
  tier→`ValueError`. Pure (no FastAPI/AWS); `allowed`/`default` are params (server config owns them).
  Tests in `server/tests/test_policy.py` (6, TDD). `pyproject.toml` wires `server/` into pytest
  (`testpaths += server/tests`, `pythonpath = ["server"]`); core stays installed editable from `src`.
- `notebooks/deterministic_pipeline_demo.ipynb` (#29) · `literature_rag_demo.ipynb` (#32/#33) ·
  one-shot **LLM→spec** and **RAG→spec** demo notebooks (#38, parallel session).
- `docs/handoff.md` — this file (tracked, #35).

## Discoveries (gotchas — most also in auto-memory; see MEMORY.md)
*(Append-only. Prior findings preserved; newest at the end.)*
- **TDD discipline:** thin frozen models; behavior lives in functions. Some happy-path tests are
  characterization (green-on-arrival) — flag them honestly.
- **Design split ("Way B"):** `Criterion` → `Constraint` (hard min/max) + `RankingTarget` (soft
  direction/weight/on_missing). Weights are **proportional, sum to 1**.
- **`identifier` vs `record_id`:** Candidate.identifier = source-returned identity; Provenance.record_id
  = per-value receipt. Coincide in single-source v1.
- **Materials Project API** is a sandboxed mirror: `X_API_KEY` header; query-id ≠ returned-id; units
  not in payload (pinned per-field in the adapter); `origins[]` = per-property provenance. [memory]
- **Retrieval = thin REST adapters** (ADR 0001), injected `http_get`, lazy `requests`, `live` marker.
- **Cloudflare bans `Python-urllib` UA (403);** `requests`/browser UA pass. Change UA, don't retry.
- **Hypothesis-layer decision RESOLVED → MEDIUM** (cited spec-deltas bridging fuzzy goal → DB proxies);
  deterministic core ≈ MP-API by design; Rich is v2. [memory: hypothesis-layer-open-decision]
- **LangGraph note:** checkpointer ⊇ #9 trace + resume; BaseStore ↦ #10 lab memory. Decide before #23.
- **pre-commit `ruff format` can ABORT a commit** by reformatting staged files — re-`git add`, re-commit.
- **Literature RAG (#17, PR #31):** abstract-only (ADR 0002); MP = fact layer, RAG grounds *direction*
  + *cited claims*. Keep+flag missing abstracts (rank on title), drop only works empty in BOTH title
  and abstract, keep zero-relevance hits stable, score stamped by `_rank` on frozen copies.
- **OpenAlex specifics:** abstracts as `abstract_inverted_index`; ~20–40% null abstracts; `id`/`doi`
  are URLs (strip prefixes); keyless, set `mailto` for the polite pool. Endpoint `/works?search=&…`.
- **Formula-aware tokenizer + v2 debt** (`_tokenize` keeps TiO2 / La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 intact). v2: case-fold,
  synonymy, sub-formula, stemming; unicode-minus formulas don't survive. [memory: rag-tokenizer-v2-todo]
- **BM25 small-corpus gotcha:** N=2 docs → IDF=0 → all-zero scores; ranking tests need ≥3 docs.
- **DFT/XC-functional comparability (V2):** MP values are functional-dependent, not cross-functional
  rankable; v2 tag functional in provenance + flag. [memory: dft-xc-functional-comparability-v2]
- **no-mistakes bootstrap:** `axi run` can't START a fresh run (maps to `rerun`). Recovery that WORKED
  from the **main repo**: `git push no-mistakes <branch>` fires the post-receive hook → creates a run
  (auto-started, no intent) → `axi abort` → `axi run --intent "…"`. From a worktree the hook misfires
  (`invalid gate path: .`); run from the main repo. The gate refuses ANY uncommitted/untracked file —
  stash untracked `docs/` first. [memory: no-mistakes-run-bootstrap]
- **— Session 6 (2026-06-21, this session): LLM provider #21 —**
- **Structured output ≠ truth, only form.** Pydantic validation conforms the LLM's *shape*; truth is
  enforced by citations + the human gate + the deterministic pipeline + output validator (#20).
- **The "Medium" payoff is unproven until #22/#23/#17 produce genuinely-cited proxy-bridges.** The
  deterministic core ≈ an MP-API query+sort by design, so the agent's value lives in the hypothesis
  layer; clean plumbing alone risks "Medium collapsing back toward Thin."
- **model_validator rules are INVISIBLE to the JSON schema the LLM receives.** The original
  flat-`Proposal` + `_payload_matches_kind` validator let Bedrock emit `kind="ranking_target"` with no
  payload (legal per schema). Fix = **discriminated union** (#34): the `oneOf` per-branch-required
  payload is now IN the schema, so structured output conforms. **Lesson: encode LLM contracts in the
  schema, not in hidden validators.**
- **LLM structured-output flakiness MEASURED (#21 stress test).** 20 live Bedrock calls across 10
  subagents: **17/20 pass, 3 fail — all SCHEMA-class, 0 infra/throttling.** Three *distinct*
  malformations each caught by a *different* validator: (a) `proposals` returned as a JSON **string**,
  (b) ElementRule payload **flattened** to the proposal top level, (c) Constraint with **both bounds
  null**. ⇒ a generic **retry-on-ValidationError loop (#23) is load-bearing, not optional** (~15%
  trigger rate); per-field coercion can't cover all modes. The gate correctly rejecting these IS the
  safety property. [memory: llm-structured-output-flakiness]
- **Bedrock model id needs the `us.*` inference-profile form** — the bare `anthropic.claude-…` id
  raises `ValidationException: on-demand throughput isn't supported`.
- **Credential detection for the live test:** gate on `botocore.session.Session().get_credentials()`
  (defensive import), which resolves env vars / a profile / `~/.aws/credentials` without reading the
  secret — better than checking env-var names (creds from `~/.aws/credentials` never hit `os.environ`).
- **`load_dotenv()` does NOT load `~/.aws/credentials`** (INI read by boto3, not a `.env`). conftest
  loads `.env` at collection time so `skipif` sees vars; AWS keys in `.env` must use UPPERCASE names.
- **— Session 7 (2026-06-21, this session): LangGraph orchestrator decision —**
- **LangGraph-vs-hand-roll RESOLVED → LangGraph**, because Kian confirmed **real `resume --from` +
  human-in-the-loop (spec gate) are in v1 scope** — those ARE LangGraph's checkpointer + `interrupt()`,
  so hand-rolling them is reinventing tested framework storage/resume. [memory: langgraph-orchestrator-decision]
- **The reframing that settled it (Kian's):** checkpointer and `runs/<id>.json` are *two different
  jobs*, not competitors. Checkpointer = **live execution state** (resume/recovery, framework-owned,
  transient); `runs/<id>.json` = **durable audit report** (what `view=audit` renders, OURS) — a
  **read-only export from `get_state_history()`**, ONE write path + one derived read model, NOT two stores.
- **This dissolves the earlier "opaque checkpoint" worry:** the durable artifact is our exported JSON
  (our schema); the checkpoint DB is ephemeral; and because the graph is **linear**
  (gate→spec→hypothesis→retrieve→filter→rank→synth→validate→render) the super-step↔named-step mapping
  is ~1:1, so the exporter is thin (`.values` / `.metadata.writes` → `TriageRun`/`Step`).
- **Not free — design discipline:** the checkpointer only persists what's routed through **typed graph
  state**, so make graph state = our domain pydantic state (one channel per step) or the audit export
  loses provenance/excluded-set/missing-flags. Revises deep plan: `core/run_trace.py` → exporter,
  `memory/store.py` → `BaseStore` wrapper. Node `RetryPolicy` ↦ the ~15% flakiness loop, but likely a
  **custom node** to retry ONLY on pydantic `ValidationError` and feed the malformed output back.
- **— Session 8 (2026-06-21, this session): input-side guardrails / threat model —**
- **A keyword denylist is NOT how guardrails work.** Frontier safety = defense-in-depth (training-time
  alignment, trained input/output classifiers, capability gating, monitoring), never substring
  matching. Kian pushed on this; reframed the gate accordingly. [memory: input-gate-mechanism-decision]
- **Co-locate each defense with the capability it constrains — not at the query door.** The brief's 4
  asks each belong to a *different* layer: forbidden-actions → capability-by-construction + (future)
  per-tool egress allowlist + per-node least privilege; no-fabrication → output validator #20; stay-in-
  role/social-eng → trust boundary #19 + constrained output + per-step role re-grounding. The input
  gate is the **weakest of 5 layers**, not the safety guarantee. (ADR 0004.)
- **v1 gate design (Kian rejected both "full hybrid now" and "deterministic allowlist"):** the brittle
  part was the *scope* decision. Solution — put scope/role in the **spec-building LLM's system prompt**
  (free: it already reads the query), keep a thin deterministic **forbidden-action denylist** for cheap
  certain logged refusals, and defer a dedicated scope *classifier* to v2 (hybrid). Manual spec-field
  edits are gated by **pydantic schema validation** (typed values can't carry an injection).
- **Trust-boundary wrapper must be unforgeable.** A fixed delimiter is useless (open code → attacker
  types the closer). Construction = **XML tags (model adherence) + an unguessable per-request nonce
  (anti-breakout) + escaping (collisions) + the system-prompt directive (obey-in-place)**, plus input
  hygiene (unicode-normalize, strip zero-width/control/bidi, max-length cap). The wrapper owns only the
  *structural* boundary; the rest is other layers. (ADR 0004 expansion #43.)
- **Granular forbidden categories** (`wet_lab`/`private_data`/`paywalled`) beat one `forbidden_action`
  bucket — needed to log *why* it refused. Watch denylist false-positives: dropped `"run a"`
  (would refuse "run a screening"); avoided `"internal"` alone (vs "internal energy").
- **— Session 9 (2026-06-22): fast-track end-to-end demo + task reconciliation —**
- **Vocabulary drift → silently-empty results.** The hypothesis LLM free-named properties
  (`band_gap_eV`) the MP adapter doesn't query (`band_gap`), so every candidate came back `missing`
  and 0 ranked. Fix = **vocabulary binding**: a `SourceAdapter.property_vocabulary()` publishing the
  retrievable names+units, fed into the hypothesis prompt ("use ONLY these names"). The adapter — not
  the LLM — owns the queryable surface.
- **Only the live end-to-end run caught the integration bugs** unit tests missed: the vocab drift
  above; a **PI/audit view mismatch** (rendering called the pipeline twice → two different LLM runs;
  fix = render BOTH views from ONE `TriageRun`); and a **VRH-modulus dict crash** (MP returns
  `{voigt,reuss,vrh}`, not a float → collapse to `vrh` via a `_scalar()` helper before the `PropertyValue`).
- **Spec-expressiveness gap is the real "H₂O ranked top" root cause** — not a missing hardcoded ban.
  The spec can't say "require a metal cation", so an over-broad window admits ice. Filters are
  request-derived, never hardcoded bans; a query that *wants* water still gets water. (Detail in
  `docs/fast-track-learnings.md`; design fix in `docs/ultimate-design.md`.)
- **`python-dotenv` is an optional import** — if uninstalled, the CLI's `load_dotenv` silently no-ops,
  so `X_API_KEY` never loads → a confusing 401. A real CLI needs a **preflight credential check** that
  names the missing var, not a silent skip.
- **Reconcile the task tracker against `main`, not against branches.** Only **#34** was mis-marked
  (completed, but the orchestrator nodes are still pass-throughs — it was fast-track-only, never merged)
  → flipped to pending. #22's role-prompt half is merged (#46) but the task stays pending.
- **Leverage order for candidate quality (fast-track §2):** *spec-schema expressiveness > server-side
  filters > prompt wording.* Prompt tweaks nudge spec quality but cannot create expressiveness the
  schema lacks — that's why H₂O survived three prompt revisions. → new tasks **#37** (expand spec),
  **#38** (push filters server-side), **#39** (derive vocabulary from schema), **#40** (RAG into synthesis).
- **Vocabulary and spec schema must co-evolve.** The MP API publishes ~50 queryable filters; deriving
  all of them is pointless if the spec can express only ~6 (numeric min/max). Grow them together (#37+#39).
- **Synthesis ordering-fidelity is NOT enforced.** Observed: the prose called a candidate "first" that
  the deterministic ranker placed fourth — grounding passed (ids resolve) but ordering wasn't checked.
  The narrative must agree with the numeric rank (folded into #40).
- **— Session 10 (2026-06-22): hosting & step-cache design (brainstorm, no v1 code) —**
- **Frontend = render-only; backend = the whole agent.** The chat UI + the right-side 9-step banner
  (a live render of the `TriageRun`/checkpoint stream) are `web/`; everything that touches secrets or
  holds the paused-run state is `server/`. The HITL `interrupt()` makes a stateful backend mandatory.
- **Bedrock has NO paste-able user API key** (auth is AWS IAM / SigV4) — so "BYOK on Bedrock" is
  awkward by nature. Standard practice = **Pattern 1: pooled account + meter-and-bill** ("their
  account" = an account on *our* platform). True BYO-spend is Pattern 4 (paste an Anthropic key → 2nd
  `ChatAnthropic` transport) or enterprise Pattern 2 (cross-account IAM `AssumeRole` + `ExternalId`),
  both deferred. One cloud = **AWS** specifically because Bedrock is there (IAM role, no key juggling).
- **Monolith on AWS now, designed to split FE/BE later; serverless rejected** (Lambda's 15-min cap +
  statelessness fight long, *pausable*, streaming runs). **Monorepo** (`server/` + `web/` siblings
  importing the pure core) — no separate repos; the boundary that matters is "don't pollute the core."
- **Step cache = the cross-attempt "check."** Content-addressed `key(step)=H(step_name, RECURSIVE
  resolved_inputs, source_version, llm_salt for LLM steps)`. Recursive inputs + a real `source_version`
  are the two correctness load-bearers (get either wrong → silently stale science). Decisions: **cache
  LLM steps for repro + a force-fresh toggle** (global first; bumps `llm_salt`); force-fresh hypothesis
  cascades downstream *automatically* because keys change. **No TTL** (correctness via `source_version`,
  age-evict for space). **Global shared cache incl. LLM** — public data ⇒ cross-user reuse is free,
  zero privacy cost; per-user scoping only on `thread`/`attempt`/lab-memory. Hosted UI adds a NEW
  `thread`/`attempt` grouping (v1 resume was crash-recovery only). All in **ADR 0005**.
- **Checkpointer must move off `MemorySaver`** to a durable+shared backend (Postgres/DynamoDB) before
  >1 instance, or paused HITL runs are lost on restart. Both `view=pi`/`view=audit` read ONE stored
  `TriageRun` (re-confirms the Session-9 double-LLM-render fix). SSE for step events, POST for actions.
- **`.git/info/exclude` gotcha:** a prior session put both `.lavish/` (correct) and the exact path
  `docs/design/0005-hosting-and-step-cache.md` (a hack) into the *local, shared-across-worktrees*
  exclude file — so the freshly-written ADR showed `git status` clean and would never have committed.
  A **no-mistakes session was running on the `feat/spec-expressiveness-37` worktree**, so docs work was
  moved to a separate `docs/hosting-adr-0005` worktree off `origin/main`; the ADR was `git add -f`'d
  there (leaving the shared exclude untouched to keep the #37 worktree clean for its gate).
- **— Session 11 (2026-06-22): first server-side build increment (#52) —**
- **The cache belongs in core, not server.** Kian pushed on a `cache_key` placement: the boundary
  isn't pure-vs-impure but *web-vs-not*. The core package already holds execution machinery
  (orchestrator, checkpointer, `run_trace`, `memory/store`); the step cache is a sibling of those and
  the step-cache is a **locked agent capability** (predates hosting), so its pure logic lives in core.
  `server/` owns only web concerns (FastAPI/SSE/auth/limits/metering + *choosing* the storage backend).
  ⇒ started instead with a genuinely-server-side unit (the model policy).
- **The no-mistakes gate runs in its OWN worktree, not your checkout.** The editable install resolves
  to `~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/<id>` (a gate-managed checkout), so "plain `pytest` fails in my dir" is
  a red herring — the gate installs the core + applies the `pythonpath` there. Verify locally with
  `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" pytest`; the gate's plain `pytest` works in its own env. Still must
  **bootstrap from the main repo, not a worktree** (hook misfires) → had to remove the
  `feat/hosting-server` worktree and check the branch out in the main repo (needed the user's OK to
  use the main-repo checkout, which had been bounded for a now-finished #37 gate).
- **Gate `ask-user` finding can be a cross-branch artifact.** The document step flagged "ADR 0005
  referenced but missing" — true on `feat/hosting-server`, but the ADR was committed on the separate
  `docs/hosting-adr-0005` branch (shipped as #53). Verified the file's existence on that branch before
  approving, rather than letting the gate author a duplicate ADR (it even guessed a different filename).
- **Two-PR split shipped:** #52 (server policy, via the no-mistakes gate) and #53 (docs: ADR 0005 +
  `.gitignore` + handoff, pushed + PR'd directly since it's docs-only and a gate run was monitoring #52).
  Merge docs-first/alongside so the ADR reference resolves on `main`.
- **— Session 12 (2026-06-22): #37 area D shipped (value-level trust metadata, PR #55) —**
- **Cut a field nothing fills.** Planned D1 `PropertyValue.uncertainty` was DROPPED — MP's DFT values
  carry no error bar, so it'd be a present-but-always-`None` slot. Same test killed it and KEPT
  `method`/`xc_functional`: *does any v1 producer fill this?* [memory: no-uncertainty-field-on-propertyvalue]
- **`Provenance.method` is REQUIRED** (`experimental`/`computational`/`ml_predicted`/**`literature`**).
  The 4th value was added because `Provenance` is reused for OpenAlex literature passages (not just MP
  values), so a required method needed a value that fits a document. Producers stamp it
  (MP=`computational`, OpenAlex=`literature`); it's **producer-knowable, not value-inferable**.
- **`xc_functional` is OPTIONAL** — honestly unknown for untraceable values, N/A for literature. Unlike
  `method`, it can't always be known.
- **The functional isn't in the MP summary endpoint — and varies PER PROPERTY.** Live-probed: `origins[]`
  is keyed by MP-internal doc names (`energy`/`structure`/`electronic_structure`/`elasticity`…), NOT our
  field names, and carries only `task_id`; the functional (`run_type`: GGA / GGA+U / r2SCAN) lives in the
  **task doc**. So the adapter now makes **two calls**: summary (requesting `origins`) → one **batched
  `/materials/tasks/?task_ids=…&_fields=task_id,run_type`** → per-property `Provenance`. Bridge =
  hardcoded `_FIELD_ORIGIN` (our field → origin name; vendor knowledge in the adapter). Absent origin
  (e.g. no elasticity run) → `xc_functional=None`. Within one material band_gap can be GGA while the
  energy is r2SCAN — confirmed live.
- **MP summary exposes ~69 fields (22 numeric + 6 boolean); the adapter supports only 6.** `_FIELD_ORIGIN`
  is correctly scoped to those 6 — expanding is **#39**, and `FIELD_UNITS`+`_FIELD_ORIGIN` must grow in
  **lockstep** (a lockstep invariant test was proposed + deferred to #39). Not every field is
  functional-bearing (counts/booleans aren't). [memory: mp-summary-field-surface-and-field-origin-scope]
- **Only the live run is the real test** (again): unit tests pass offline, but the per-material run_type
  variation + absent-origin → `None` behaviour was confirmed only by hitting the real MP API.
- **D rebased onto post-area-A `main` with ZERO conflicts.** Area A (#51) never touched
  `Provenance`/`PropertyValue`, and the one shared file (`_query_params`) merged cleanly — the result
  carries BOTH area A's `element_predicates` block and D's `origins` field. The two handoff-doc commits
  on D's branch were dropped from the rebase (`git rebase --onto main 227de49 <D3d>`) to avoid noisy
  doc conflicts; their content lives in this update + the `backup-D-20260622` tag.

## Work Done (all merged to `main` unless noted)
*(Append-only history.)*
- **Sessions 1–4 (≤2026-06-20):** Provenance/PropertyValue/Candidate/Constraint/RankingTarget/
  TriageSpec/TriageResult models; `normalize`; `apply_hard_filters`+`missing_data`; `on_missing`;
  weighted-average ranker; SourceAdapter+stubs; Materials Project adapter + composition scoping;
  pre-commit ruff hook. Literature RAG (#17) DESIGNED. MP demo notebook + ADR 0001 built.
- **Session 5 (2026-06-21) — literature RAG #17 built, shipped, demoed:** TDD in a worktree
  (`_reconstruct_abstract` → `LiteraturePassage`+`_parse_work` → `_rank`+tokenizer →
  `LiteratureRAG.search`+`AbstractFetcher` → live `OpenAlexFetcher`); added `rank-bm25`; ADR 0002.
  Validated via no-mistakes (review caught the null-title batch-crash bug → fixed). Merged: **#31**
  (RAG), **#29** (MP demo + ADR 0001), **#32** (RAG demo notebook), **#33** (notebook cleanup).
  Memories saved: rag-tokenizer-v2-todo, dft-xc-functional-comparability-v2.
- **Session 6 (2026-06-21) — hypothesis layer + LLM provider #21:**
  - Settled hypothesis-layer richness = **MEDIUM** (Rich = v2); built the hypothesis models +
    `compile_spec` (merged earlier as **#30**).
  - Chose the LLM-provider design: injected `complete` seam (Option A, mirrors `http_get`); lazy
    `ChatBedrockConverse.with_structured_output`. Built `agent/llm.py` via TDD (B1 tracer → B2 spy →
    B3 lazy guard → B4 live).
  - Live Bedrock run exposed that `model_validator` rules don't reach the LLM schema → refactored
    `Proposal` into a **discriminated union** (`extra="forbid"`); migrated tests + added a schema
    regression test.
  - Added `tests/conftest.py` (`load_dotenv`), the `llm` extra (`langchain-aws`), `python-dotenv` in
    `dev`, a botocore credential gate, and a hermetic `test_rag.py` fix.
  - **20-run robustness stress test** (10 subagents) → ~15% schema-flakiness finding; documented the
    live test as flaky and recorded [memory: llm-structured-output-flakiness].
  - Shipped **split** PRs via no-mistakes: **#34** (discriminated union) and **#36** (provider #21) —
    both 0 findings, CI green, merged. Pruned `docs/handoffs/` (kept this tracked `docs/handoff.md`).
- **Session 7 (2026-06-21) — LangGraph orchestrator decision (no code):**
  - Shipped **#37** (handoff update). A parallel session shipped **#38** (one-shot LLM→spec and
    RAG→spec demo notebooks).
  - **Settled the parked LangGraph decision → adopt LangGraph for #23** (resume + HITL in v1 scope).
    Worked through the checkpointer-vs-`runs/<id>.json` confusion with Kian and landed on
    checkpointer = live state / JSON = derived audit export. Recorded
    [memory: langgraph-orchestrator-decision]; indexed in MEMORY.md.
  - Proposed the #23 TDD build order (8 slices: compiling graph+checkpointer → domain state model →
    deterministic-core nodes → retry node → `interrupt()` spec gate → exporter → `resume --from` →
    `BaseStore` lab memory). Slices 4 & 5 clear the two orchestrator-23-carryforward debts.
    **Awaiting "start building" + a decision on whether ADR 0003 (orchestrator-on-LangGraph) lands
    first or folds into the #23 PR.**
  - **Reconciled the task list:** marked #17 (RAG) and #21 (provider) completed; added #32
    (hypothesis layer: models + `compile_spec` discriminated union) and #33 (LLM→spec / RAG→spec
    demos) as completed retrofit entries; sharpened #23's description to include the retry loop +
    the two weight-confirmation / error-wrap debts + the LangGraph checkpointer⊇#9 / BaseStore↦#10
    mapping.
- **Session 8 (2026-06-21) — input-side guardrails (#18/#19) + threat-model docs:**
  - Resumed; decided **ADR 0003 lands as its own commit** → shipped **#40** (ADR 0003 orchestrator-on-
    LangGraph). (Parallel session then merged **#41** skeleton + **#23** retry/HITL orchestrator.)
  - Created the `feat/input-policy-gate` worktree; built the gate via TDD: `GateDecision` + in-scope
    tracer (A) → wet-lab refusal (B) → private-data (C) → paywalled (D). **4 passing tests**, denylist
    refactored to `_FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS`. WIP **uncommitted**.
  - Long design discussion → **reframed the gate** (allowlist-first scope triage; weakest of 5 layers)
    and chose the **v1 = denylist + role-system-prompt** approach. Shipped **#42** (ADR 0004 guardrail
    architecture & threat model), then **#43** (ADR 0004 expansion: wrapper construction + attack-surface
    table). Drafted a reader-facing exploit/social-engineering guide but **deleted it at Kian's request**
    (shipped only the ADR in #43).
  - Saved [memory: input-gate-mechanism-decision] (+ reframe); indexed in MEMORY.md.
- **Session 9 (2026-06-22) — orchestrator completion (parallel) + fast-track demo + docs + cleanup:**
  - Parallel session **completed the orchestrator**: merged **#45** (hypothesis retry + spec-build HITL
    gate) and **#47** (audit export + crash-recovery resume + lab memory) → #23/#24/#9/#10 done; and
    **#46** (input-side guardrails #18/#19 + role prompt `agent/prompts.py`).
  - **Fast-track demo build** (throwaway branch `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`, pushed, **no PR to
    `main`**): wired the whole pipeline end-to-end — gate (`check_input`), hypothesis (trust-boundary
    `build_chat_messages` + vocabulary binding), retrieve/filter/rank, synthesis (`core/synthesis.py`,
    grounded+cited), output validator (`agent/validator.py`), PI/audit renderers (`render.py`), and a
    `cli.py` + `scripts/demo.py`. Verified live (MP + Bedrock) across 5 parallel subagent runs;
    diagnosed + fixed vocab drift (added `property_vocabulary()`), the VRH-dict crash, and the PI/audit
    view mismatch. **196 tests** passed on the branch.
  - Shipped **docs-only** PRs: **#48** (kid-friendly 9-step README flowchart) and **#49**
    (`docs/fast-track-learnings.md` + `docs/ultimate-design.md` + handoff pointer); used `/lavish` to
    visualize the ultimate design.
  - **Cleanup:** deleted the stale merged remote branch `docs/literature-rag-demo` (superseded by
    #32/#33; notebook already on `main`); removed the fast-track + policy-gate worktrees; `stash@{0}`
    holds the parallel readme-kid-flowchart notebook WIP; kept untracked `.mcp.json`.
  - **Reconciled the harness task tracker vs merged `main`** (this session): flipped **#34 → pending**
    (fast-track-only; nodes still pass-throughs), confirmed #22 stays pending, verified all other
    statuses correct. Refreshed this handoff (`/handoff update`).
  - **Added 4 v1 build tasks from the fast-track learnings** (Kian's call — full v1, not doc-only):
    **#37** expand spec expressiveness (booleans/counts/element-class — fixes H₂O), **#38** server-side
    filter pushdown, **#39** schema-derived vocabulary, **#40** wire literature RAG into synthesis
    (citations + caveats + ordering-fidelity). Deps wired: #38/#39 ← #37; #40 ← #35 + #20.
- **Session 10 (2026-06-22) — hosting & step-cache design (brainstorm; no v1 code):**
  - Briefly explored the **output validator (#20)** via `/tdd` (read the fast-track `validator.py` +
    `synthesis.py` reference, scoped the slice, surfaced the coupled-vs-decoupled `Synthesis`
    dependency) — then **paused** because a parallel session is editing the spec (#37).
  - Long **hosting brainstorm** with Kian: sorted his 3 asks into FE/BE; settled topology (monolith on
    AWS → splittable), billing (**Pattern 1** pooled+meter; Bedrock has no user API key), repo layout
    (**monorepo**, `server/` + `web/` siblings), the SSE+POST request/stream protocol incl. the HITL
    spec-gate pause, the storage layers, and the **content-addressed step cache** (both caching +
    idempotency + cross-attempt diff; LLM cached-for-repro + force-fresh; no TTL; global shared cache).
  - **Visualized via `/lavish`** (`.lavish/hosting-design.html`) — Kian reviewed in-browser, requested
    the §4 flow as a **Mermaid sequence diagram** (applied), and queued answers resolving all 4 open
    questions (Q1 global force-fresh first · Q2 no-TTL/`source_version` · Q3 global shared cache · Q4
    → write ADR + add tasks).
  - **Wrote ADR 0005** (`docs/design/0005-hosting-and-step-cache.md`) and **added 10 harness tasks**
    (#1–#10) for the hosting build with deps (2←1, 3←2, 4←1, 7←6, 8←7, 9←7+2, 10←2); #1/#5/#6 unblocked.
  - **Worktree shuffle:** discovered ADR 0005 + `.lavish/` were locally excluded via `.git/info/exclude`
    (a no-mistakes session is running on the `feat/spec-expressiveness-37` worktree). Reverted a stray
    `handoff.md` edit there to keep that worktree clean, then moved all docs work to a fresh
    **`docs/hosting-adr-0005`** worktree off `origin/main`; force-added the ADR, added `.lavish/` to the
    tracked `.gitignore`. **This PR is docs-only.**
- **Session 11 (2026-06-22) — first server-side build increment + ship both PRs:**
  - Built **`server/mt_server/policy.py` `resolve_model`** TDD, one red→green slice at a time (6 tests),
    after Kian redirected from `cache_key` (which belongs in core) to a genuinely-server-side unit.
    Wired `server/` into `pyproject` pytest discovery.
  - Drove it through **no-mistakes** (run `01KVRJ67…`): review 0 findings, test passed (server tests ran
    green in the gate's own checkout), one `document`-step `ask-user` finding (ADR-0005-missing) — verified
    the ADR exists on the docs branch and **approved** rather than authoring a duplicate. → **PR #52**,
    CI green, merged.
  - Pushed the docs branch + opened **PR #53** (ADR 0005 + `.gitignore` + Session-10 handoff) directly
    (docs-only). Both PRs **merged**.
  - Ran **`/sync-main`**: `main` → `129cb0a`; removed the `mt-hosting-docs` worktree; force-deleted the
    two merged branches (`feat/hosting-server`, `docs/hosting-adr-0005`); restored the main repo to `main`.
  - Refreshed this handoff (`/handoff update`, **this PR**).
- **Session 12 (2026-06-22) — #37 area D (value-level trust metadata) built, shipped, merged:**
  - In the `mt-value-trust` worktree, TDD one model/function at a time (6 signed commits): D1
    `Provenance.method` **required** + `literature` (every existing `Provenance` fixture across 7 test
    files updated) → D2 `Provenance.xc_functional` optional → D3a `_origin_task_ids`+`_FIELD_ORIGIN` →
    D3b `_field_task_id` → D3c `_fetch_run_types` (batched tasks call) → D3d wired into `retrieve`
    (per-property provenance + functional). Scope changed mid-build per Kian: **`uncertainty` cut**;
    **adapter population pulled in** (originally deferred). Live-probed the real MP API to design against
    actual `origins`/`run_type` shapes.
  - **Rebased onto post-area-A `main`** (#51/#52/#53) with **zero conflicts**; 206 tests pass, ruff clean,
    live-verified. Pushed to origin; Kian ran no-mistakes from the main checkout → **PR #55 merged**.
  - Saved memories: `no-uncertainty-field-on-propertyvalue`, `mp-summary-field-surface-and-field-origin-scope`.
  - Ran **`/sync-main`**: `main` already at `06e4eae`; force-deleted merged `feat/value-trust-metadata`
    (local + remote auto-deleted); refreshed this handoff (`/handoff update`, **this PR**).

## Status
- **`main` @ `06e4eae`** (this update is on branch `docs/handoff-d-merged`, pending PR). Recently
  merged: **#51** (#37 spec expressiveness — boolean/element/count predicates), **#52** (server model
  policy), **#53** (ADR 0005 + `.gitignore` + handoff), **#54** (Session-11 handoff), **#55** (#37 **area
  D** — trust metadata). Main repo on `main`, clean.
- **#37 area D — DONE + MERGED (#55):** `Provenance.method` (required, +`literature`) and
  `Provenance.xc_functional` (optional, populated **per-property** by the MP adapter via a batched
  `origins → tasks run_type` second call). **Still open in #37:** area B (element-class constants
  `METALS`/`TOXIC` + the "what counts as a metal" decision — needs Kian); area C (ranking beyond
  weighted-sum) was deferred from the start.
- **Server build STARTED (ADR 0005, harness tasks HB1–HB10):** `server/mt_server/policy.py`
  `resolve_model` shipped (#52). `server/` is wired into pytest. **Done:** the model-policy slice of
  HB4 + the test-discovery half of HB1. **Pending:** see the Hosting build task list below. Net-new,
  **outside the v1 deep-plan** — sequence vs. v1 per Kian.
- **Parallel sessions:** none in flight. `feat/value-trust-metadata` merged (#55) + pruned.
  `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails` retained as the reference impl (no PR).
- **v1 still not started on `main`:** #34 (orchestrator nodes still pass-throughs), #20 (output
  validator), rest of #22 (prompts), #35 (synthesis), #25/#26 (renderers), #27 (CLI), #28 (eval),
  #29 (design note), #30 (README/CLAUDE finalize), #31 (element-drop reasons), #36 (docs); fast-track
  quality fixes **#38/#39** (← #37, merged; **#39 also owns the `FIELD_UNITS`/`_FIELD_ORIGIN` lockstep
  invariant + expanding past the adapter's current 6 of MP's ~22 numeric fields**) → #40.
- **Known issues:** Live Bedrock smoke test ~15% flaky by design (mitigated by #45 retry). The stale
  local `.git/info/exclude` line 9 (ADR-0005 path) is now obsolete — **delete it** (file is tracked).
  `stash@{0}` (readme-kid-flowchart WIP) still unmerged.
- **Open threads:** v2 hybrid LLM scope check; v2 debts (RAG tokenizer, DFT/XC comparability);
  cross-source merge (doc-only ladder in `docs/ultimate-design.md`).

## Hosting build task list (ADR 0005)
*Harness tasks #1–#10. Labeled **HB1–HB10** here to avoid colliding with the v1 task numbers
(#1–#40) used elsewhere in this doc. "Blocked by" uses the same HB labels.*

| HB | Task | Status | Blocked by |
|----|------|--------|-----------|
| HB1 | Scaffold monorepo `server/` + `[server]` extra | **partial** — pytest test-wiring done (#52); FastAPI `[server]` extra pending | — |
| HB2 | Backend run API + SSE step stream | pending | HB1 |
| HB3 | HITL spec gate over HTTP (resume) | pending | HB2 |
| HB4 | Auth tiers + rate limit + model policy + metering | **in progress** — `resolve_model` model-policy slice done (#52); tier resolution, rate limiter, metering pending | HB1 |
| HB5 | Durable shared checkpointer (replace `MemorySaver`) | pending | — |
| HB6 | `source_version` on source adapters | pending | — |
| HB7 | Content-addressed step cache (key + recursive inputs) — *lives in core, not server* | pending | HB6 |
| HB8 | Force-fresh toggle + idempotency short-circuit | pending | HB7 |
| HB9 | Thread/attempt storage + cross-attempt diff | pending | HB7, HB2 |
| HB10 | Frontend `web/` chat UI + steps banner | pending | HB2 |

Unblocked and ready: **HB4** (continue — tier/rate-limit/metering), **HB5**, **HB6**, and HB1's
remaining `[server]` extra. Net-new, **outside the v1 deep-plan** — sequence vs. v1 per Kian.

## Next Steps
*(One function at a time, stop for approval after each; see CLAUDE.md. Don't start coding until told.)*
1. **Land this handoff PR** (`docs/handoff-d-merged`) → squash-merge → `/sync-main`. Then delete
   the obsolete `.git/info/exclude` line 9 and remove the now-done `mt-value-trust` worktree
   (`git worktree remove`). The `backup-D-20260622` tag (pre-rebase D tip) can be deleted too.
2. **Continue the server build (task #4) — next pure server-side increments:** tier resolution
   (`resolve_tier(session) -> "anon"|"user"`, feeds `resolve_model`), then the **rate limiter**
   (token-bucket `allow(key)` with an injected clock — per-IP anon / per-user signed-in), then
   **metering**. All pure/offline like `resolve_model`; FastAPI routes (#2) come after these.
3. **OR resume v1** (Kian's call on priority): **#20 output validator** (pure
   `validate_output(result, synthesis, retrieved_ids)`; confirm coupled-vs-decoupled `Synthesis`) →
   **#35 synthesis** → **#34 wire** the orchestrator nodes. Port from `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails`.
   Note #37 (spec expressiveness) is now merged, so the `Constraint`/spec model #20/#35/#34 build
   against is current.
4. **Then:** renderers (#25/#26), CLI (#27), eval (#28), design note (#29 — must articulate the
   spec-expressiveness > server-filters > prompt leverage order), README/CLAUDE (#30), element-drop
   reasons (#31), docs (#36).

## Context for Next Session
- **Branch:** this handoff update is on **`docs/handoff-d-merged`** (in the `mt-value-trust` worktree,
  repurposed now that D is merged; off `main` `06e4eae`); PR pending → squash-merge → `/sync-main` →
  remove the `mt-value-trust` worktree. `feat/fast-track-wire-guardrails` (local + origin, no PR) is the
  reference impl to port from. Worktrees: `materials-triage` (main) + `mt-value-trust` (this branch).
- **How to verify merged state:** `python -m pytest -q` (207 passed, 3 deselected), `ruff check .`.
  Live (needs creds): `pytest -m live` (Bedrock via `~/.aws/credentials`, OpenAlex, MP). RAG quick
  check: `OPENALEX_MAILTO=… python -c "from materials_triage.retrieval.rag import LiteratureRAG,
  OpenAlexFetcher; print(len(LiteratureRAG(OpenAlexFetcher()).search('perovskite oxygen evolution', k=5)))"`.
- **Credentials:** `X_API_KEY` (MP sandbox); `OPENALEX_MAILTO` optional (polite pool); AWS creds for
  Bedrock — prefer `~/.aws/credentials` (botocore auto-detects; `load_dotenv` won't load it). conftest
  loads `.env` for live tests; AWS keys in `.env` must be UPPERCASE. **Never read/print the AWS creds
  or `X_API_KEY` — those are the secrets.**
- **Git workflow:** `main` protected, signed commits (`git commit -S`, SSH), squash-merge via GitHub
  UI, then `/sync-main`. pre-commit `ruff format` can abort a commit → re-add + re-commit.
- **Auto-memory (persists):** see `MEMORY.md` — incl. input-gate-mechanism-decision,
  langgraph-orchestrator-decision, hypothesis-layer (RESOLVED→MEDIUM), ranking-weight-normalization,
  orchestrator-23-carryforward, llm-structured-output-flakiness, langgraph-msgpack-unregistered-types,
  orchestrator-exclusions-two-sources, resume-is-crash-recovery-not-knob-edit,
  dft-xc-functional-comparability-v2, rag-tokenizer-v2-todo, adapter-testing-seam,
  materials-project-api, handoff-doc-location, worktree-pythonpath, no-mistakes-run-bootstrap,
  spec-predicate-vocabulary-design, no-uncertainty-field-on-propertyvalue,
  mp-summary-field-surface-and-field-origin-scope.
- **Task tracker (reconciled 2026-06-22 vs merged `main`):** #1–#19, #21, #23, #24, #32, #33 completed
  (#9/#10 subsumed by the orchestrator); **#37 spec expressiveness** = area A (#51) + area D (#55)
  DONE, area B (element-class) + area C (ranking) still open. **Pending:** #20, #22 (role-prompt half
  merged), #25–#31, #34 (fast-track-only — nodes still pass-throughs), #35, #36; **fast-track-learning
  tasks** #38 (server-side pushdown), #39 (schema-derived vocab **+ FIELD_UNITS/_FIELD_ORIGIN lockstep**),
  #40 (RAG→synthesis; deps #38/#39←#37, #40←#35+#20).
